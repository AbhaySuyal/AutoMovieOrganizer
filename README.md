# AutoMovieOrganizer
AutoMovieOrganizer automatically cleans, identifies, and organizes your movie collection. It fetches details from TMDb, renames files neatly, and sorts them by language, genre, and collection. Subtitles are matched automatically, turning messy folders into a clean, structured, and enjoyable movie library.
